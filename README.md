# OreSat Solar ModulesThis repo contains several designs for [OreSat's](oresat.org) solar array. The arrays are based on [Alta Devices](https://http://www.altadevices.com/) GaAs 5 cell solar modules, which produce about 1 W in AM0 (space) conditions. Part of OreSat's design is a module bus system that spans 1 - 3 U, so each array is its own 1U "panel". OreSat is 2U, so we have 2 of these modules per side. This approach has pretty severe drawbacks in terms of solar cell coverage area, but it's extremely flexible as our plans, and thus power needs, change.  Because we have relatively poor solar cell coverage, we need to squeeze every electron out of these boards as possible, so each 1u panel will have its own **true** maximum power point tracker onboard.  If the MPPT is not active for whatever reason ( ie dead microcontroller), the panel will default to CV of 8.4 V, which is our maximum battery charge.# Rev 1 DesignOur first design is based on a SPV1040 Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) IC, an STM32F0 processor because CAN-based telemetry, and an LTC2990 sense IC (V, I and T) because that chip does everything. A pair of MOSFETs connect to our "system shutdown" signal that keeps the cubesat powered off until deployment. # Rev 2 Design: "Everything was Broken, Now it Isn't"So our first design broke horribly when we moved from a 1S battery pack to a 2S pack, because the SPV1040 can't supply high enough voltages to charge the 2S batteries.  So in standard OreSat fashion, we decided to make our own ~~crappy~~ super cool open source MPPT!  The LT1618 Buck-Boost Converter has an option "Iadj" input, which allows the user to select the current input.  We are utilizing this feature along with the INA226 V/I sensor, MAX5805 I2C DAC, and our favorite STM32 M0 microcontroller.  In short, the M0 calculates the MPPT using data from the INA226, and uses the I2C DAC to output an analog voltage on the Iadj so that the output of the LT1618 is at the MPP.  The calculations will be still be done using the incremental conductance algorithms, because we aren't complete scrubs.  The M0 will be reporting the V/I data (along with temperature values from tmp101) to our C3 flight computer over CAN. You can find all of the design and CAD files in the ['1u_panel' folder](https://github.com/oresat/solar/tree/master/1u_panel).# Rev 3 Design: "Downloading more RAM"We made the decision early on to standardize our processors as much as possible across all of our subsystems, and our 'lightweight' processor was the stm32f04x.we ran into some problems on some of our systems that required more RAM, but didn't warrant a full A8 (our big boy processor), so we made the decision to move to a stm32f09x on all stm32f0 boards, we also moved to from 0402s to 0603 because we our poor ~~indentured servants~~  interns kept getting hand cramps while stuffing boards.# Rev 4 Desing: "RIP Alta"Our previous solar cell manufacturer, Alta devices, went out of business, so we had to move to the XTE-SF CIC from Spectrolabs.  Due to the change in dimensions, each module now has two CICs wired in series.# Solar Panel Verification: "Solar Simulator"Our LED based solar simulator designed to test the response of our solar panels in extreme conditions.
